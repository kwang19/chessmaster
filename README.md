If you encounter 'Cannot load such file â€” bcrypt_ext'.
The problem was that bundle install of devise installed as a dependency another version of bcrypt (bcrypt (3.1.11 x86-mingw32) instead of bcrypt (3.1.11)) which was causing trouble with ruby 2.3 (it should work with all previous versions of ruby)

The solution I used is to install bcrypt outside of the gemfile, run bundle and then remove the second version of bcrypt 


  
$ gem list bcrypt
bcrypt (3.1.11 x86-mingw32)

$ gem uninstall devise && gem uninstall bcrypt
Successfully uninstalled devise-4.2.0
Successfully uninstalled bcrypt-3.1.11-x86-mingw32
